Investigation of factors most significant to house sale price using 2006-2010 housing data from Kaggle

The housing market is complex and often difficult to navigate for prospective homeowners. Our research addressed the question of which physical factors of a home are the most significant determinants of sale price. Previous studies have observed that the key determinants that affect real estate prices are the national economy, interest rates, and government policies, but these studies have tended to neglect the importance of the physical attributes of the house itself. We used a dataset collected from kaggle.com that consisted of 2,919 residential home property sales that occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010 as well as the quality and quantity of physical attributes of the home to determine the impact those attributes had on sale price.  We found that as the age of a house increases by one year, the sale price decreases by 21.4%. Compared to single story houses, two story houses are associated with a decrease in sale price by 14.2% while one and one-half story houses are associated with a decrease in sale price by 8.22%. In addition, having a “severe” classification (severely damaged houses) decreases sale price by 57.46% compared to 11.85% for “moderate” classification (moderately damaged houses) in comparison to houses with typical functionality. Surprisingly, although garage area and total floor square footage were significantly positively associated with sale price, the estimated effects were not practically significant.
